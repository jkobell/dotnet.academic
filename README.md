Summary: jQuery front-end making AJAX calls to the Get and Post Controller methods, and a Entity back-end with SQL database.

A Category selection change event will cause a call to the Controller Get method that corresponds to the selected Category. A table is created to display the results. User will mouse click on any table row to place items in Shopping Cart table. A different category may be selected at any time.

Description: A Database Table Maintenance Application.

Summary: index.aspx has a Gridview/Table to display all of a db table. A dropdown option select will select a table row by ProductID. UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE can be performed on the selected table record. The back-end is a aspx C# file. A SESSION object is used to hold persistent data such as the selected dropdown value.
